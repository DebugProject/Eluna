Incase you are using an older or newer version of TC,
you can wrap the methods again.
(If you get compile errors)

To do this, download SWIG, place it to the source folder,
move Eluna.i and SWIG.bat from \src\LuaEngine to the SWIG folder and run SWIG.bat

This updates the runtime file and Eluna_Wrap.cpp
