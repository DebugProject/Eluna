## ABOUT

Eluna is a Lua Engine for World of Warcraft emulators. Our main site is [Emudevs] (http://emudevs.com). Eluna's team is working hard to support other emulators rather than just one. MaNGOS is supporting us and they're updating the MaNGOS source to work for their emulator. 


We want to be the major Lua source for World of Warcraft emulation. If you need help regarding methods, hooks and other wiki related documentation, go to [Eluna's Wiki](http://wiki.emudevs.com/doku.php?id=eluna).

## MORE INFORMATION

This is the MAIN Eluna information repo. Instead of getting rid of it to confuse everyone, we just decided to make it the information center. The standalone source no longer exists. We had recent changes that allowed us to move TrinityCore sources to a forked repo (only Cataclysm seeing WotLK was already added). You can find those in the links below, along with the MaNGOS links if you prefer MaNGOS.

The reason why we changed is because we agreed to alter TrinityCore's source due to most of their class members being private. That being said, enjoy Eluna Lua Engine!
